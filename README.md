This is a basic "ink" calculator for the graphic arts industry. 
Unlike other ink caclulators, this calculator functions to tell the user the percentage of the sheet that will have ink on it

There are several reasons why someone may need this. Primarily, in estimating and other basic needs for digital printing. 

This calculator will not function like ink percentage estimators in other applications. Currently, it does not give a breakdown of CMYK percentages acorss a sheet.
